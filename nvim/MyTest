** To insert the contents of a file, type `:r FILENAME`{vim}. **

 1. Place the cursor just above this line.

NOTE:  After executing Step 2 you will see text from Lesson 5.3. Then move
       DOWN to see this lesson again.

 2. Now retrieve your TEST file using the command

        `:r TEST`{vim}

     where TEST is the name of the file you used.
     The file you retrieve is placed below the cursor line.

 3. To verify that a file was retrieved, cursor back and notice that there
    are now two copies of Lesson 5.3, the original and the file version.

NOTE: You can also read the output of an external command. For example,

        `:r !ls`{vim}

      reads the output of the `ls` command and puts it below the cursor.
